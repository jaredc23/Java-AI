# Java-AI
This is an AI using Java

Files: all nessesary files are provided to be able to run a basic program, with comments to with explain code. 
 
# How to train the AI:
 ~Create a net as seen in Net_Runner.java
 
 ~Then call the ".teach" function, and as the first parameter put the input of the net, and as the second parameter the desired output for those inputs. And thats all!
 
 ~The net was designed to be easy to implement in any program, so using Net_Runner.java, copying/pasting basic syntax and filling in your own code will probably work.
 
# Extra information:
For large nets saving can take a bit of time, and if you exit the program it may corrupt the save file and result in an incomplete net.
