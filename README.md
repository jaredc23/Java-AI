This is an AI using Java

Files: all nessesary files are provided and comments with explain code. 
How AI works in general is *not* explained, rather the comments are explaining what it code is doing, not *why*
 
# How to:
How to train the AI:

 ~Create a net as seen in Net_Runner.java
 
 ~Then call the ".teach" function, and as the first parameter put the input of the net, and as the second parameter the desired output for those inputs. And thats all!
 
 
# Extra information:
For large nets saving can take a bit of time, and if you exit the program it may corrupt the save file and result in an incomplete net.
