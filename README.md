# Java-AI
This is an AI using Java

To view the demo, make sure to click "view raw" after clicking on "AI Demo.MOV" which will download the video, since GitHub does not support videos

Files: all nessesary files are provided to be able to run a basic program, with comments to with explain code. 
 
# How to train the AI:
 ~Create a net as seen in Net_Runner.java
 
 ~Then call the ".teach" function, and as the first parameter put the input of the net, and as the second parameter the desired output for those inputs. And thats all!
 
 ~The net was designed to be easy to implement in any program, so using Net_Runner.java, copying/pasting basic syntax and filling in your own code will probably work.
 
# Extra information:
For large nets saving can take a bit of time, and if you exit the program it may corrupt the save file and result in an incomplete net.
