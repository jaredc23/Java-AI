# Java-AI
This is a proof of concept AI using Java

Files: all nessesary files are provided and comments with explain code. 
How AI works in general is *not* explained, rather the comments are explaining what it code is doing, not *why*
 
# NOTE:
The ai now learns! You can also save and load neural nets!

How to train:
 Create a net as seen in Net_Runner.java
 
 Then call the ".teach" function, and as the first parameter put the input of the net, and as the second parameter the desired output for those inputs. And thats all!
