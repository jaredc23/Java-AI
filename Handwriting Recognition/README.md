# Please Read!!!!

  The code for the GUI is not my code!!! The gui was modified from the AP PixLab for AP Computer Science A in the 2018-2019 school year.
  The implementation of the AI to learn, show percent accuracy, and the button to get next picture is mine!
  
  If you would like to see what I wrote, then open pictureExplorer.java and scroll to line 126. If you would like to train the AI, just set that value to "true" and on line 131 change the number to how many times you would like to train.
  
  With that said, The ai used is the exact same AI class reflected in NeuralNet.java
  Once again, I am not claiming to have written any of the GUI code. I just wrote the AI library and implemented it into the already made GUI of PixLab.
